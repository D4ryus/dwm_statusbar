- move most of the stuff to /proc
- implement /proc/loadavg
- implement /proc/cpu-something
- implement /proc/net/dev -> up/down speed
- implement /proc/net/arp -> show current gateway ip
- implement /proc/net/tcp -> show last used ip, change current way, since very buggy
- implement /proc/devices -> show dev and current up/down

- fix bug with ip not changing (change to /proc/net/tcp)
- fix bug with suspend -> exit
